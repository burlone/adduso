addusò
======
addusò, is a italian dialect word: "dove sono", it's an open source project.<br>
This idea was born after an American trip when my parents were concerned when they didn't receive a call from me at a fixed time... :)<br>
With addusò you can save your GPS position directly from your smartphone.<br>
You only need to connect to your administration page and click the "check" button to save your position.<br>
Your parents and friends can connect to your website and they can see your movements.

Is written in PHP code and it's a easy and smart project.
